This was a group project built by James Burgess and Cyrus Warner using React for the front-end and Django for the back-end

This project was built for people looking for a site where they can create collections of flashcards and study anything they would like. The application also comes with animations created by Framer Motion API.

The application homepage consists of a search bar a modal for creating a new collection and a short description of the collections shown below.

After clicking on see flashcards that will bring you over to the flashcard display page. A user will have CRUD functionality for each flashcard and comes with a display to show the current flashcard a user is on and to improve the UX of the application we included a show all flashcards button with a fade in animation.
